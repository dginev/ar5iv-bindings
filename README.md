# arxmliv-bindings

Extended LaTeXML bindings for converting the older sources of arXiv.org

Sourced from:
https://arxiv.org/help/macro_list

Excluded files that are:
 - already supported by the mainline LaTeXML distribution
 - available under texlive 2021
 
 The initial work in this repository went as far as to tease away the Fatal status of a report over 100 arXiv documents.

### ðŸš§ High Velocity

For all intents and purposes, the bindings in this repository are highly *experimental*.

As support stabilizes and matures, bindings of sufficient quality will swim up to the mainline LaTeXML "Package" support, and will be removed from this repository.
