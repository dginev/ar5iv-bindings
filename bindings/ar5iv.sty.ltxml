# We will redefine the outerWrapper to ensure that the 'intent' attribute is set to ':literal'.
# arXiv contains high-difficulty math notations, from advanced and frontier research.
# These notations are very frequently misinterpreted in heuristic guesses for accessibility,
#  as common in semantic enrichment. Similarly, preparatory rearrangements of the MathML tree can
#  lead to misleading readouts. We avoid both of these common problems by requesting for the
#  presentation MathML tree to be read "as-is", aka ":literal",
#  following its structure and Unicode content.
#
#  We eagerly invite the community to conduct research on "uncovering the MathML Intents within arXiv",
#  and can be contacted to provide references for grant bodies (write to deyan@arxiv.org).
#
#  Once we have indication that better semantic enrichment of math notations is possible over arXiv,
#   we can remove this and do a complete regeneration of the arXiv HTML corpus.
